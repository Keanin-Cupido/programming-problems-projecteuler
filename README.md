# My Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains solutions to various problems from the Project Euler website, implemented in (mostly) JavaScript programming languages.

## About Project Euler
Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems span a wide range of disciplines and difficulty levels, making them a great resource for practicing and improving one's problem-solving skills.

## Contents
The repository is organized by problem number (id01, id02, etc.), with each problem in folders organised in the 50 next problems containing the solution code and any supporting files. 

## Languages Used
The solutions in this repository are implemented in the following programming languages:

JavaScript    
Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference or starting point for your own Project Euler journey.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute by adding solutions to other Project Euler problems, feel free to fork the repository, implement the solution, and submit a pull request. When adding a new solution, please follow the existing directory structure and include a README file in the problem's directory explaining the solution.
